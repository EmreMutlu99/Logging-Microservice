# Use-Case and Context

In a production environment, event logs must be recorded. Some companies do this by saving events to text files, while others have their own logging systems in place. This project is a plugin-based solution that stores event logs in a database and provides a front-end interface for in-server monitoring.

It works as follows: any microservice running on the server makes a POST request to the logger orchestrator microservice provided in this project whenever an important event occurs. The orchestrator then saves the information into the database and serves as a gateway to provide an interactive front-end interface for monitoring the logs.

# Logger Service

A centralized logging system designed to collect logs from multiple independent services and display them through a user-friendly web interface. The application is ideal for internal log tracking within companies and provides both RESTful API endpoints and a responsive frontend dashboard.

## Requirements

This project is designed to run **only on Linux systems** and requires the following dependencies:

- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL 16.4** ‚Äì Ensure it's installed and running  
- üê≥ **Docker** ‚Äì Required to run the logging service container  
- üêç **Python** ‚Äì Required to install Prisma

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have **PostgreSQL 16.4** installed and accessible. The logger service is tested with this specific version.



## How to Run


### 1. .env Setup
.env file must be also in the /prisma directory. So if .env doesn't exist in /prisma directory:
```env
cp .env /prisma/.env
```
üí° Or manually create.

#### .env Example

```env
SERVER_TYPE=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/Logger
```

### 2. Apply Database Schema (First Time Only) 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
> If you're running the project on a clean PostgreSQL instance (no tables created yet), run:
>
> ```bash
> # to check prisma
> pip install prisma 
> prisma db push
> ```
> to apply the schema to the database.

### 3. Quick Start

To reach ./docker_run.sh options:
```bash
# Help
./docker_run.sh --help
```

Execute commands:
```bash
# Without rebuild
sudo ./docker_run.sh
```
or
```bash
# With rebuild
sudo ./docker_run.sh --build
```

### 4. Access Frontend

```
http://127.0.0.1:3005/index.html
```
